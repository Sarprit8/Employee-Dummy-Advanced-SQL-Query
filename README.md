# Employee-Dummy-Advanced-SQL-Query
This dataset represents dummy employee information containing essential columns such as Employee ID, Name, Department, Salary, and Date of Joining. Using this table, a set of 10 real-time SQL queries has been executed to demonstrate various practical scenarios encountered in data analysis and database management.
The solved queries include operations such as:
  Finding the Second and Third Highest Salaries.
	Calculating Total Salary of Each Department.
	Computing Total Salary by Total Employees and Department.
	Identifying Departments with the Highest, Lowest, Second Highest, and Second Lowest Total Salaries.
	Finding Employees with the Same Salary across or within Departments.
	Applying a 10% Salary Increment to Employees Serving More Than Two Years in the Company.
For each of these scenarios, the respective SQL queries have been provided without the use of other operator i.e. LIMIT, along with their accurate output results, to showcase both query construction and expected results.
